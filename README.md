# NHSUK (Helm) Charts

> A repository for storing and developing Helm charts for the NHSUK program.

## Repository structure

The repository is organised into two folders:
* stable
* development


### Stable charts

Charts in `stable` have achieved some as yet to be defined measure of quality.

### Development charts

Chart in `development` are in development and will not meet the same criteria
as those in `stable`.
A chart will begin within `development` until it has met the criteria to move
into `stable`.
